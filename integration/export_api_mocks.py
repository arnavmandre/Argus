"""
Adapter: simulator report -> frontend mock API responses.

The web frontend in `frontend/` is built against the *proposed* HTTP API in
docs/FRONTEND_BACKEND_HANDOFF.md. That API does not exist yet: there is no
FastAPI service, no job queue and no run store. So that the dashboard is not
built against invented numbers, this script records the real simulator report
as fixtures shaped exactly like the proposed endpoints.

    Simulation/urbantwin_demo_output.json   (the real run, 0-100 metrics)
        -> THIS SCRIPT
        -> frontend/mocks/*.json            (recorded API responses)
        -> frontend/app/api/*               (route handlers serving them)

Every fixture is labelled `"source": "recorded_fixture"` and `/api/health`
reports `mode: "mock"` with every capability false, so the UI can never present
a recorded run as a live backend. When the Python API is built, point
`URBANTWIN_API_BASE` at it and the same route handlers proxy instead.

This script does NOT invent data. Metrics, advisor text, problem places and
behaviour counts are copied from the report; only the API envelope (run ids,
status, pagination, warnings) is added here.

Run:
    python integration/export_api_mocks.py
    python integration/export_api_mocks.py --report Simulation/urbantwin_demo_output.json
