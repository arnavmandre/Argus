"""
Phase 10 step 4 - give the synthetic citizens somewhere to live and go.

`generate_citizens.py` produces behaviour, not geography. The simulator also
needs `home` and `destination` building ids with a route between them, so this
attaches them for a chosen city file and writes a citizens file that loads.

Homes are drawn from buildings with capacity 0 (pure origins); destinations are
drawn from buildings that have capacity, weighted by it - a 5,000-capacity
transit hub receives more trips than a 400-capacity shop. Only pairs that
actually have a route are used, so the output always passes the simulator's own
validation.

Trip assignment is NOT survey data. The survey asked how people feel in an
environment, not where they commute. This step is a documented trip-distribution
heuristic; the behavioural parameters are the calibrated part.

Run:
    python phase10/assign_homes.py                         # against city_osm.json
    python phase10/assign_homes.py --city city.json        # 8-building demo
    python phase10/assign_homes.py --count 400 --out ../Simulation/citizens_survey.json
