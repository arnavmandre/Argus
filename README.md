# Argus AI

Human-centric urban digital twin: a **Python pedestrian simulator**, an **OpenUSD / Omniverse** city stage, and a **web dashboard** that can run live scenarios and (optionally) stream the RTX viewport in the browser.

Product name in the UI: **Argus AI**. Internal package/path names may still say `urbantwin` (Kit apps, env vars such as `URBANTWIN_API_BASE`).

Metrics, comfort indices, and advisor text are **heuristic prototypes** — not medical, meteorological, or engineering models. Citizen behavioural parameters are **survey-calibrated** (41 participants); scenario factors are confounded; home/destination placement is a heuristic.

## What this repo contains

| Area | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simulator | `Simulation/` | Deterministic city + citizen model; route choice; heat/rain/crowd stress; threshold advisor; before/after interventions. Run `python main.py` for asserts + demo. |
| Local HTTP API | `api/` | `python -m api` — scenario POST, single-worker Phase 11 pipeline, health/stream probe, view allow-list, optional RAG advise. |
| Dashboard | `frontend/` | Next.js UI. Default = recorded fixtures (`mode: "mock"`). With `URBANTWIN_API_BASE` → live API (`mode: "live"`). |
| Integration | `integration/` | Snapshot export, route mapping proposals, pipeline orchestration, API mock export, validation gate. |
| City / USD | `phase1/`–`phase9/` | OSM → semantics → bridges → packaged states → materials, trees, cameras, agents. **`phase1`–`phase8` scene layers are frozen**; add `over` layers in `phase9/`. |
| Survey | `phase10/` | Survey → calibrated synthetic citizens. |
| Docs | `docs/` | Contracts, phase notes, demo runbook, RAG notes. |

### End-to-end product loop

1. Operator sets temperature / humidity / rainfall / population in the dashboard.
2. API runs `Simulation/main.py` on OSM city data (and optional interventions).
3. Pipeline exports canonical snapshots → USD agents/routes for the Kit stage.
4. Dashboard shows metrics, problem areas, and advisor recommendations.
5. Optional: Kit App Streaming (WebRTC) shows the live RTX view; camera / overlay / playback commands are allow-listed then sent over the data channel.
6. Optional: RAG layer ranks grounded intervention suggestions; the **threshold advisor in the simulator** remains the execution authority.

## Quick start (one click)

**Prerequisites (once):** Python on PATH, Node.js (`cd frontend; npm ci`), RTX GPU + Kit App Template with `launch_urbantwin_streaming.bat` for streaming, **Chrome or Edge** for WebRTC.

1. Double-click:

   ```text
   C:\Users\arnav\Argus\Start-Argus.bat
   ```

2. If ports 8000/3000 are stuck:

   ```text
   C:\Users\arnav\Argus\Start-Argus.bat -Force
   ```

3. Wait for the browser. Expect **Live backend** in the header. The Omniverse viewport should reach **Live** when Kit signaling is up (often 30–60s).

4. To stop: close the API, Kit, and Dashboard service windows.

Equivalent PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\arnav\Argus
.\tools\demo_launch.ps1
# or: .\tools\demo_launch.ps1 -Force
```

Logs: `tools/demo_logs/`. Full operator notes: [`docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md).

### Manual launch (if the bat fails)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\arnav\Argus

# 1) API
python -m api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# 2) Kit (separate shell)
C:\Users\arnav\omniverse\kit-app-template\launch_urbantwin_streaming.bat

# 3) Frontend (separate shell)
$env:URBANTWIN_API_BASE = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Checks:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
# expect mode: "live"
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/stream/config
# expect status: "available" when Kit signaling listens, else honest "offline"
```

Dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (or `3001` if 3000 is busy).

### Mock-only dashboard (no API / no Kit)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\arnav\Argus\frontend
npm run dev
```

Without `URBANTWIN_API_BASE`, the UI replays fixtures and must not be presented as a live backend.

---

## Using the dashboard

| Control | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario sliders | Accepted ranges (e.g. temperature **-10…45 °C**). Values outside the range are refused before a run starts. |
| Run simulation | Queues one Phase 11 pipeline job (single worker). Limited animation frames are used for faster demos. |
| Before / After | Metrics and viewport state for baseline vs intervention arm when interventions were applied. |
| Overlay | **Behavior** (agents + routes), **Routes only**, **Shade canopy** (Phase 8 ADD_SHADE proposal), **City only**. |
| Animation | Play / Pause / Restart on the Kit timeline (needs Live stream). |
| Advisor | Threshold recommendations from the simulator; optional RAG ranking if configured. |

Scenario sliders do **not** live-update the USD stage — they apply on the next **Run**.

---

## What we built (phases)

| Phase | Deliverable |
| --- | --- |
| 1–8 | OSM city → USD semantics, contract, bridges, stressed vs intervention packaged states (frozen layers). |
| 9 | Materials, heights, trees, lighting, cameras, agent instancing (`phase9/scene/main.usda` is the Kit demo stage). |
| 10 | Survey-calibrated synthetic citizens. |
| 11 | Local orchestration: sim → snapshots → USD (`integration/run_pipeline.py`). |
| 12 | Local stdlib HTTP API (`python -m api`). |
| 13 | Headless streaming Kit app + stage autoload. |
| 14 | Browser WebRTC client (`@nvidia/ov-web-rtc`) + stream TCP probe. |
| 15 | Allow-listed view commands → WebRTC → Kit `urbantwin.view_commands` (camera, overlay, before/after, playback). |
| 16 | Constrained explain endpoint (deterministic by default). |
| 17 | Demo launcher + runbook (`Start-Argus.bat`, `tools/demo_launch.ps1`, `docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`). |
| RAG | Optional grounded advisor over completed runs (`docs/RAG_URBAN_ADVISOR.md`). |

### Simulator advisor (no LLM required)

After the **before** arm, `urban_advisor()` in `Simulation/main.py` applies fixed thresholds:

- heat stress ≥ 60 → `increase_shade`
- rain impact ≥ 30 → `improve_drainage`
- crowding ≥ 55 → `alternative_pedestrian_routes`
- else → `no_major_intervention`

Those IDs map to `shade_boost` / `drainage_boost` / `route_capacity_boost` for the **after** re-sim. Shade becomes a drawn cyan canopy in USD; drainage is metrics-only today (no separate USD type).

## How we verified it

Run these from the repo root. Prefer claiming only what still passes on your machine.

### Simulator unit / demo asserts

```powershell
cd Simulation
python main.py
```

Self-contained deterministic tests plus a short demo write to `urbantwin_demo_output.json`.

### Local API contract

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s api -p "test_*.py"
```

Covers validation (scenario ranges, view allow-list including playback), run manager behaviour, shapes, optional RAG tests when deps are present.

### Integration gate (sim → snapshot → USD)

```powershell
python integration\validate_integration.py
```

Traces simulator values into snapshots and authored stage geometry (agent placement, edge ids, heat normalisation, intervention proposals). Metrics-only interventions such as `drainage_boost` are allowed without a drawn USD proposal.

### Pipeline / export interfaces

```powershell
python -m unittest integration.test_export_interfaces integration.test_run_pipeline
```

### Frontend typecheck

```powershell
cd frontend
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Demo smoke (API must be up)

```powershell
python tools\demo_smoke.py
```

Health, stream config, short live run, view allow-list, optional explain.

### Manual streaming check

1. Launch with `Start-Argus.bat`.
2. Header: **Live backend**; `/api/stream/config` → `available` when Kit is up.
3. Viewport chip: **Live** (not only “stream online” in the header).
4. Change Camera / Overlay / Play–Pause; Kit should respond when WebRTC is connected.
5. Extreme heat scenario → Run → metrics update; **Shade canopy** overlay shows the ADD_SHADE proposal when Intervention state is available.

## Integrity notes (do not over-claim)

- Building heights: only a subset come from real OSM; the rest are inferred — do not call the skyline fully surveyed.
- Default small `city.json` is abstract; use `city_osm.json` when geography matters.
- Agent motion between frames is interpolated for display; edge colours are equilibrium — not a continuously evolving physics sim.
- Omniverse stream stays offline until Kit signaling is actually listening; mocks must not be presented as live.
- `integration/route_mapping.json` is reserved for a **team-agreed** mapping; tools emit `route_mapping.proposal.json` only.
- Never edit `phase1/`–`phase8/` scene layers; extend with `over` layers in `phase9/`.

## Kit / Omniverse (without the web stream)

Open the Phase 9 composed stage in the UrbanTwin Kit app:

```text
C:\Users\arnav\Argus\phase9\scene\main.usda
```

Kit app (outside this repo): `C:\Users\arnav\omniverse\kit-app-template`  
Launch desktop editor: `.\repo.bat launch -n urbantwin.kit`  
Launch streaming host: `.\launch_urbantwin_streaming.bat`

Phase 8 stressed / intervention switch (packaged variants):

```powershell
python phase8\switch_state.py stressed
python phase8\switch_state.py intervention
```

Then **File > Reopen** in Kit if you are not using the streaming autoload path.
